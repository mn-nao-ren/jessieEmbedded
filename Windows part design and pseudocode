Algorithm pseudocode (need to find the exact registry addresses from datasheet later on)

for windows-usb, usb-ADXXXX microcontroller, mbient-ADXXXX microcontroller, the drivers will implement the following:

read write open close ioctl 

windows-usb, usb-ADxxxx interface: find equivalent functions in the cypress usb programmer's guide:
i2c_open()
i2c.open()
i2c_open()
i2cOpen(WITH_LOCK)
i2c.ioctl_changeFrequency(THIRTY_MHz)
i2cIoctl(kChangeFrequency, THIRTY_MHz)
